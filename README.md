# Programming Languages

**About**
---

This repository contains the three mains assignments from *CC4101 - Programming Languages* course, 7th semester, Computer Science Engineering
Created on March 16th, 2021. This course has a wide range of Functional Programming topics, such as:

- Substitution and First-Order Functions
- First-Class Functions and Scopes 
- Recursion
- Mutation
- Macros
- Objects

**Requirements**
---
- Download and install [DrRacket](https://racket-lang.org/) (Language-Oriented Programming Language),
- Clone this repository locally in your computer,
- Run the main files as described by each assignment.

**Assignment 1**
---
This first assignment consists of the implementation of a simple language, with first-order functions, basic types of data, and simple operators. This language contains dynamic type checking, static type checking and dynamic contracts as described in the [assignment 1 statement](https://pleiad.cl/teaching/cc4101/tareas/2021-1/tarea1).

To run this language, you must open the **t1.rkt** file in `Programming_Languages/Assignments/T1/` folder using Racket. You can also run the tests saved in the **p1-tests.rkt**, **p2-tests.rkt** and **p3-tests.rkt** located in the same folder.

**Assignment 2**
---
The main of this assignment is the implementation of infinite data structures as streams, In a language that combines strict evaluation and lazy evaluation (call-by-need) as described in the [assignment 2 statement](https://pleiad.cl/teaching/cc4101/tareas/2021-1/tarea2).

To run this language, you must open the **main.rkt** file in `Programming_Languages/Assignments/T2/` folder using Racket. You can also run the tests saved in the **tests.rkt** located in the same folder.

**Assignment 3**
---

The final assignment of the course consists of the extension of a base language in order to sustain objets and delegation as described in the [assignment 3 statement](https://pleiad.cl/teaching/cc4101/tareas/2021-1/tarea3).

To run this language, you must open the **main.rkt** file in `Programming_Languages/Assignments/T3/` folder using Racket. You can also run the tests saved in the **tests.rkt** located in the same folder.
